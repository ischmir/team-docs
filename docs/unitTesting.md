# Unit Testing

- **Tests individual functions and components** in isolation to ensure correct behavior.  
- **Detects bugs early** in development before code is integrated or deployed.  
- **Improves code quality and reliability** through consistent test coverage.  
- **Supports test-driven development (TDD)** for writing more maintainable code.  
- **Runs quickly**, enabling fast feedback during development.
