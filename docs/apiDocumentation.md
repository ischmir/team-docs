# API Documentation

## Introduction

- Briefly explain the purpose of the API and its intended use.
- Mention the base URL for the API.

Welcome to the API documentation for our project. This API allows developers to interact with the system programmatically to retrieve and manage data.

- Describe how to authenticate with the API (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens, etc.).
- Provide examples of how to include authentication in requests.

## Endpoints

List all available API endpoints, grouped by functionality (e.g., user management, data retrieval).  
For each endpoint, include:

-   HTTP Method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

- **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid API key.
- **404 Not Found:** Resource not found.

## Rate Limiting (if applicable)

Explain any rate limits or quotas for API usage.

## Examples

Provide sample code snippets in different programming languages (e.g., JavaScript Python) to demonstrate how to interact with the API.
